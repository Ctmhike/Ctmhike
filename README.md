## Hi there, Just Smile and Be Happy 😄

My name is Cecil Mhike. I am a Ms in Electrical and Computer Engineering Student at Michigan Technological University. 
I am interested in Circuit Design & Analysis, HVAC BMS, Automation (PLCs and Control Systems).
I am AWS, PLC, SQL, Git, HVAC Systems, MATLAB and Azure certified.

- 🔭 I am intrested in Industrial Automation, PLC Programming, PID Control and Circuit Analysis.
- 🌱 Developed a closed-loop PWM voltage regulation system using PID control, including duty-cycle saturation logic to prevent instability and ensure safe operation.
- 🌱 Developed an EV Auxiliary 12V Power Rail from 400 HV Bus - Load Management and Protect
- 🌱 I Designed a High Availability Motor Control System with Automatic Failover, Trip Interlocks and Alarm Management.
- 🌱 Recently designed a 4 bit Full Adder using in Cadence Virtuoso using the XOR, AND, OR gates as a group project.
- 🌱 I Designed and tested a 3-phase motor control system (FW/BW + DOL) with interlocking and overload protection, and evaluated star–delta vs VFD methods for inrush-current reduction.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any project that you think i might be of help with.
