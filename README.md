## Hi there 👋

My name is Cecil Mhike, and i am a Ms in Electrical and Computer Engineering Student at Michigan Technological University. 
I am interested in Python, Robotics using ROS2, PLC Programming, industrial Automation including knowledge of Motors, sensors, actuators (Relays & Contactors), Embedded systems!
I am AWS and Azure certified with aim of getting a CCNA certification.

- 🔭 I’m currently advancing my knowledge in LLMs using python, Robotics utilising the ROS2 software in Linux enviromnent, and Industrial automation using (RsLogix 500, RsLogix Emulate 500, and RsLinx).
- 🌱 I recently designed a 4 bit Full Adder using in Cadence Virtuoso using the XOR, AND, OR gates.
- 🌱 I recently designed and tested a 3-phase motor control system (FW/BW + DOL) with interlocking and overload protection, and evaluated star–delta vs VFD methods for inrush-current reduction.
- 🌱 I recently tested how the amount of data used to train an LLM affects the way a LLM predicts the next word.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any project that you think i might be of help with.
  - You can email me on cecilmhike911@gmail.com
