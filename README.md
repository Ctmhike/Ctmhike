## Hi there 👋

My name is Cecil Mhike, and i am a Ms in Electrical and Computer Engineering Student at Michigan Technological University. 
I am interested in BAS, HVAC, Automation (PLCs and Control Systems), Robotics using ROS2.
I am AWS, PLC, SQL, Git, HVAC Systems and Azure certified.

- 🔭 I’m currently advancing my knowledge in LLMs using python, Robotics utilising the ROS2 software in Linux enviromnent, and Industrial automation using (RsLogix 500, RsLogix Emulate 500, and RsLinx).
- 🌱 Recently designed a 4 bit Full Adder using in Cadence Virtuoso using the XOR, AND, OR gates as a group project.
- 🌱 I Designed and tested a 3-phase motor control system (FW/BW + DOL) with interlocking and overload protection, and evaluated star–delta vs VFD methods for inrush-current reduction.
- 🌱 I Designed a High Availability Motor Control System with Automatic Failover, Trip Interlocks and Alarm Management.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any project that you think i might be of help with.
